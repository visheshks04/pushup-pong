# Pushup Tracker

Tracks the number of pushups so you cannot hurry or cheat your form. :)

## Setup and running

    1. Run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    2. Then run the game.py module: `python game.py`
    3. Perform your pushups facing front at the same level with the camera with 1 meter proximity.
    4. Try to  follow the ball and move your side's rectangle. Imagine that it follows your nose when you do a pushup.
